# AI-POWERED-ADAPTIVE-LEARNING-SYSTEM
The AI-Powered Adaptive Learning System is an intelligent educational platform that personalizes the learning experience for each student by dynamically adjusting content difficulty, pacing, and teaching methods based on individual learning patterns, preferences, and performance data.This project presents an  AI-Powered Adaptive Learning system designed to transform traditional educational content  into  personalized, interactive, and engaging learning experiences.The system integrates three intelligent modules. Interactive edu module that extracts content from uploaded textbooks and generates interactive explaination to enhance conceptual understanding through interactive education. A Textbook Conversion module that processes static PDFs to produce concise summaries, highlight key concepts,important topics, generate mind maps, and provide 
AI-driven Q&A to promote active learning.A Flashcard Generation module that automatically converts extracted content into studyfriendly formats such as multiplechoice questions and to support revision and retention. By leveraging natural language processing, machine learning, and document intelligence, the system adapts to each learner’s pace and preferences, aiming to improve comprehension, retention, and engagement in digital education
